# Welcome to the Multiverse

Multiverse is the collective name for all of my infrastructure managed by me. This includes:

- **Domains** - such as https://vivaanverma.com
- **Self-hosted infrastructure** - such as Raspberry Pis
- **Cloud infrastructure** - such as Cloudflare Workers

This monorepo is the central base from where Multiverse is managed through 2 primary tools.
These are ***Terraform*** by Hashicorp and ***Ansible*** by RedHat.
